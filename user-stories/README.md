# 📘 Airbnb Clone – User Stories Overview

This document provides a detailed overview of the **user stories** that define the key interactions between users and the Airbnb Clone backend system. These user stories were derived from the use case diagram created in the earlier design phase and are written from the perspective of the end users.

User stories serve as a bridge between design and development. They describe **what the user needs** and **why it matters**, guiding developers to build features that provide real value.
